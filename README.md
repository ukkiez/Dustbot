# Dust v2

You're probably looking for the dustbot-v1 branch if you're looking for info on the currently running version of Dustbot.

Dust v2 is currently in development, and heavy changes are to be expected weekly, possibly daily. It is not currently in a fully functioning state.

The website does not do much of anything (for now), but it could be a good indicator of where things are currently at.
